#### I use chrome to count down the time which takes the chrome to load sjtu homepage.  
I use 4G cellar data as the network, which is quite fast for most websites.  
_However_, I can feel the latency of the loading process, which is quite annoying.

**The website took 12 seconds to load totally**
It is quite clear that there are too much add-ons on the homepage, a bunch of javascriot and css files.  
Walking through the homepage, it is definitely that they have put too musch things on the homepage, pictures, backgrounds, dymaic effects......
Actually they could put them into several pages and make the homepage a bit more skinny.

It seems that the structure of resouce files is quite reasonable

The website also concerns compatible issus with some other broswers, which is quite considerate.

#### Comparion and suggestions
I also use chrome and the same network as before to visit https://www.harvard.edu/  
But it turns out that the web page loads a bit more _faster_

It is quite obvious that although the homepage of harvard also contains a great deal of pictures  
but contains lest dynamic effects, which means less scripts.
Not to mention that its source code seems to be more structured and less complicated.

#### In a nutshell
Less dynamic will make the page loads faster undoubtly. And using third-party services   
such as Youtube plugin to provide short videoes on the page seems to run a lot more faster.
