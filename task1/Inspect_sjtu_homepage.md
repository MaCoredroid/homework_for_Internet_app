#### I use chrome to count down the time which takes the chrome to load sjtu homepage.  
I use 4G cellar data as the network, which is quite fast for most websites.  
_However_, I can feel the latency of the loading process, which is quite annoying.

**The website took 12 seconds to load totally**
It is quite clear that there are too much add-ons on the homepage, a bunch of javascriot and css files.  
Walking through the homepage, it is definitely that they have put too musch things on the homepage, pictures, backgrounds, dymaic effects......
Actually they could put them into several pages and make the homepage a bit more skinny.
