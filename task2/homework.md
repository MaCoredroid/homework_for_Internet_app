### Resources consumption of REST service
At first I tried prometheus , which is an end point of Spring Boot actuator, but <br>
it just gave me a bunch of information, but I'd rather prefer charts.<br>
So I tried Prometheus docker imageï¼Œ but get many nasty bugs.<br>
Fotunately, I found YourKit Java profiler. <br>
