Just type in `docker run -p 8081:8081 macoredroid/calculate:one` <br>
Alternatively,`docker pull macoredroid/calculate:one`<br>
Or visit `https://hub.docker.com/r/macoredroid/calculate`<br>
Then use broswer to go to http://localhost:8080/ to visit Eureka control panel <br>

in `txt` file <br>
for example: 0 0 4<br>
Denots a circle whose center is (0,0) with radius as 4<br>

You can change https://github.com/MaCoredroid/homework_for_Internet_app/blob/master/homework3/gateway/demo/src/main/resources/application.properties<br>
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://admin:pwd@**ip of Eureka,which will be shown in the control panel**:8080/eureka<br>
In my example, the **localhost** was changed to **172.17.0.2**
